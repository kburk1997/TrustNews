Respondents were asked to evaluate a small, randomized section of a database of over 60 major news outlets on whether or not they were trustworthy using the criteria.\r\n\r\nDuring our crowdsourcing process, we had a few \"test\" questions thrown in (e.g. \"Is 'The Onion' satire?\", \"Is Fox News reliable?\") to prevent trolling or spamming.\r\n\r\n##Where can I download this extension?\r\nThis extension will soon be available on the Chrome Web Store.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
