# TrustNews
A Chrome Extension that determines if a news source is trustworthy.
Created at HackRPI 2015 by: Kathleen Burkhardt and Alex Lin

## How do we determine if a news source is trustworthy?
We ask the following questions:
* How long has it existed?
* Has it won major awards or the favor of journalistic bodies like Poynter?
* What are the potential conflicts with its corporate parent?
* What are the backgrounds of its writers and editors?
* How much original reporting is this site doing?
* How often are its basic facts in agreement with similar coverage elsewhere?

##Where do you get data for determining whether a news source is trustworthy or not?
We crowdsourced this data using CrowdFlower. Respondents were asked to evaluate a small, randomized section of a database of over 60 major news outlets on whether or not they were trustworthy using the criteria.

##What about satire news sources?
This extension displays whether or not a news source is a satire news source so that the user does not confuse satire with news.

##How do I use this extension?
* First, enable this extension under "Extensions".
* Then, go to any news site and click the TrustNews icon.
* A popup should appear determining if the extension could determine what news site you were on, if it is a satire site, and the reliability of this site.
* To see an explanation, click the "Why?" button? (currently being implemented).
